# composer-purifier

composer-purifier keeps Composer's development workflow on locked,
Nix-resolved dependencies. Use the normal build and test commands in your
working tree; building the project itself in the Nix sandbox is an
optional next step.

## Quickstart

From the project root:

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/composer-purifier#toolchain'
composer-purifier lock
composer-purifier prefetch
composer install
composer test
```

Commit the lockfiles that the lock command writes, including the build
tool's own lockfile when it has one. Keep using the project's usual build,
test and editor commands with this setup. Nix provides the locked
dependencies; the development commands above run outside the Nix sandbox.
No project Nix files are needed for this workflow.

Sandboxed builds of the whole project are an optional
[next step](#building-the-project-with-nix).

For persistent use, add these packages through your usual Nix configuration.


## Development loop

`nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/composer-purifier#toolchain'` gives PHP, the
`composer-purifier` command, its `composer`, and phpactor. The
`composer-purifier` command runs Composer as a PHP library and is not a
Composer plugin, because `lock` runs before the `vendor` directory exists.
The loop is Composer's own:

1. `composer install` prepares the locked Nix cache and installs offline,
   with a PHP that has the extensions the project requires. Run
   `composer-purifier prefetch` ahead of time for disconnected work.
2. The project runs as usual: its `bin` scripts with `php`, its tests with
   `composer test`.
3. `composer-purifier update [<package>...]` updates both lockfiles in one
   run: it runs `composer update --no-install` on the PHP that the project
   requires, for every package or only the named ones, and then
   `composer-purifier lock`. After a `composer require` or a plain
   `composer update`, `composer-purifier lock` alone records the new
   downloads and keeps the resolution of `composer.lock` as it is. Either
   way, the hashes it already has are reused, and `composer-purifier
   prefetch` then fetches the new downloads.

After changing dependencies, run `composer-purifier lock`; the next install
prepares the updated cache. Without a purifier lockfile, the wrapper warns
and runs ordinary, impure Composer.

## Dependencies from Nix projects

```zsh
composer-purifier lock --input github:example/library
composer install
```

The selected Nix package exports `projections.composer`, a native artifact
repository. Existing dependency constraints are bound automatically. Source
pins go in the purifier lock; supplied packages have no artifact records in
`composer.lock`. The wrapper regenerates those records from Nix when needed,
including the required PHP extensions. Use the wrapper for these projects.

`--refresh-inputs` advances source pins; `--no-inputs` removes them. Nix builds
load the saved pins automatically, or accept producer packages through
`dependencies = [ producer ];`. Packages and releases expose their own
`projections.composer` for further composition.

## Building the project with Nix

Once the native development workflow is working, you can also build and
test the whole project in the Nix sandbox. For this step, keep a flake or
another Nix build definition in the project's repository, or maintain an
external packaging repository that points at its sources and lockfiles.
The builder consumes the same lockfiles as the development workflow.

The flake's overlay adds one attribute to the package set, the scope
`composer-purifier`. The scope holds the builder `buildComposerProject`
beside the `composer-purifier` command. A flake that packages the project
applies the overlay and calls the builder. It can live in the repository of
the project or in another one:

```nix
{
  inputs.composer-purifier.url =
    "github:nix-purifiers/composer-purifier";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "composer-purifier/nixpkgs";

  outputs =
    { nixpkgs, composer-purifier, ... }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs =
        nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system}.extend
          composer-purifier.overlays.default;
      app =
        pkgs.composer-purifier.buildComposerProject {
        src = ./.;
      };
    in
    {
      packages.${system} = app.packages;
      checks.${system}.tests = app.tests;
    };
}
```

`composer-purifier.buildComposerProject.override` replaces the packages that
the builder takes, and `composer-purifier.overrideScope` replaces what
everything in the scope shares.

The result of `buildComposerProject` names every output from
`composer.json`, which Nix reads at evaluation time:

- `packages.<name>` is the project with its `vendor` directory under
  `share/php/<name>`, where `<name>` is the `name` of `composer.json` with
  `/` replaced by `-`. It has a wrapper in `bin/` for each entry of the
  `bin` list of `composer.json`.
- `packages.<bin>` is a package for each entry of the `bin` list, holding
  only that executable.
- `tests` runs the `test` script of `composer.json` in the sandbox, with
  the `require-dev` packages installed.
- `release` is the dist archive that `composer archive` makes,
  `<name>-<version>.zip`.
- `fetches` lists the lockfile entries that the builds fetch.

`nix/lib/build-composer-project.nix` documents the builder's arguments:
`src`, `fetchers`, `lockFile`, `composerLock`, `php`, `dev`, `noScripts`,
`composerFlags`, `pathRepositories` and `srcFilter`.
`lib.composer-purifier.readLock { src; }` gives the lock in memory of the
contract: the download entries, the outputs, and the problems of the
lockfiles, each naming the command that fixes it.

We recommend committing both lockfiles, `composer.lock` and
`composer-purifier.lock.json`, to the repository of the project. The
builder and the commands look for them there by default.

A project can instead keep its build external. The flake that calls the
builder keeps the purifier lockfile outside the repository and passes it
as `lockFile`. It can also keep its own copy of `composer.lock` and pass it
as `composerLock`, which the build uses in place of the copy in `src`. An
external build suits a project whose committed `composer.lock` is missing,
out of date or written by another version of Composer. Every command takes
`--lockfile <path>` and `--tool-lockfile <path>`, or reads the paths from
the environment variables `COMPOSER_PURIFIER_LOCKFILE` and
`COMPOSER_PURIFIER_TOOL_LOCKFILE`. With a tool lockfile, `update` writes
`composer.lock` there and leaves the copy in the repository as it is, and
`lock` starts from the copy in the repository when the outside file does
not exist yet. A dev shell that sets both variables to the paths it passes
to the builder needs no flags.

### One-off builds without a project Nix file

For an ad hoc build, the builder can also be evaluated directly from the
project root. Replace the example package name with one from your project:

```zsh
nix build --impure --expr 'let
  purifier = builtins.getFlake "github:nix-purifiers/composer-purifier";
  pkgs = import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs {
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    overlays = [ purifier.overlays.default ];
  };
in
(pkgs.composer-purifier.buildComposerProject { src = ./.; })
.packages.my-app'
```

This uses the purifier's pinned nixpkgs, matching the lock command above.
To build with ambient `<nixpkgs>` from your Nix search path instead,
replace `import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs` with `import <nixpkgs>`.
Both forms need no Nix files in your project. The build tool and language
versions must match the lockfile; with ambient nixpkgs, lock with the
purifier from that package set or pass a compatible toolchain to the builder.

## Working offline

`composer-purifier prefetch` builds three things with `nix-build`: the
Composer cache of the lockfile, Composer on the PHP that the project
requires with its `require-dev` packages, and the `composer.lock` of an
offline install. It keeps them alive with garbage-collector roots in
`.composer-purifier/`, beside the lockfile, which belongs in `.gitignore`.
The `require-dev` packages are part of the prefetch, so the tests run
offline too.

After a prefetch, the `composer` of this flake reads `.composer-purifier/`
for `composer install`, and runs it with the network disabled. Every other
subcommand is plain Composer. A package that the lockfile does not name
fails to install offline, because the network is disabled.

## Editor

PHP editors and language servers, such as phpactor and Intelephense, read
the project's `vendor` directory. A Composer dist holds the full source of
its package, so `composer install` after a prefetch gives the editor the
full source of every package. The development shell has phpactor.

## Troubleshooting

The Nix build, `composer-purifier prefetch` and the offline
`composer install` check the lockfile before they use it. Each failure says
what is wrong and which command fixes it:

| Mistake | Message |
| --- | --- |
| A command such as `composer require` added a download to `composer.lock`, and `lock` has not run since. | `composer-purifier.lock.json has no hash for the dist of <package> at <URL>, which composer.lock has. Run composer-purifier lock.` A checkout reads `the git checkout of <package> at <URL>#<reference>` in place of the dist. |
| The lockfile changed after the last prefetch. | `<lockfile> changed after the last prefetch. Run composer-purifier prefetch.` |
| Someone edited the lockfile by hand, a hash included. | `… was edited after composer-purifier lock wrote it: its content does not match its contentHash. Run composer-purifier lock --force to write it again.` |
| The lockfile is not valid JSON, or its `dists` or `sources` field is not a map of hashes. | The message names the problem and ends with `Run composer-purifier lock --force …` |
| Another version of composer-purifier wrote the lockfile. | `… has lock format version <n>; this composer-purifier reads version 4. Run composer-purifier lock --force …` |
| A download no longer matches its locked hash | Nix rejects it with `hash mismatch in fixed-output derivation`, naming both hashes |
| `composer.json` changed and `composer update` has not run | `lock` stops with `composer.lock is out of date with composer.json. Run composer update --lock first.` |

The lockfile, format 4, holds only what `composer.lock` lacks. `dists`
maps the dist URL of each package whose `shasum` is empty to the SHA-256
of the file. `sources` maps `<URL>#<reference>` of each package that has
only a version-control source to the hash of its checkout. A dist with a
`shasum` needs no entry, since Nix checks the SHA-1 of `composer.lock`.
Nix derives every URL, mirror and cache path from `composer.lock`. The
lockfile also holds `contentHash`, the SHA-256 of its other fields, so an
edit by hand fails before any download.

## Supported language repositories

Every kind of package source that `composer.lock` can hold builds, except
Perforce. The sources are Packagist and other Composer repositories with
dists, `package` repositories that name an archive URL, version-control
repositories, and `path` repositories.

- A dist, the archive that Packagist and most repositories serve, is
  fetched from its URL and the mirrors of its repository, as
  `composer.lock` gives them. This covers `zip`,
  `tar`, `gzip`, `xz`, `rar`, `phar` and `file` dists, from any repository,
  including `package` repositories that name an archive URL. Nix puts the
  file at its path in Composer's cache, where `composer install` looks for
  it.
- A package that `composer.lock` gives only a git, hg, svn or fossil
  source is recorded as a checkout of the locked revision, with the hash
  that the nixpkgs fetcher of that kind checks. The install takes it from
  the checkout as a `path` dist. Each checkout matches what Composer's
  downloader of that kind installs. A git checkout has no submodules,
  because Composer never runs `git submodule`. An hg checkout has its
  subrepositories, because `hg update` checks them out. An svn checkout has
  its externals and expanded keywords, as `svn checkout` makes them.
- A git source at an SSH URL is recorded under the HTTPS URL of the same
  host, because the Nix sandbox has no SSH keys. A private repository needs
  a `fetchgit` with credentials, passed as `fetchers.fetchgit`.
- A `path` repository inside the project directory is part of the project
  source. One outside it, such as `../lib`, goes to the builder as
  `pathRepositories."../lib" = ../lib;`, since the build copies only the
  project directory into the store.
- A Perforce source makes `lock` fail with the package name. A Perforce
  depot has no anonymous protocol that a fetcher could use, needs a server
  and credentials, and nixpkgs has no fetcher for it.

`composer.lock` is the same on every system: Composer packages are PHP
source, and the platform requirements of `composer.lock` go to the PHP of
the build. One lockfile serves x86_64-linux and aarch64-linux alike.

The default PHP of a build is the package set's `php` with every extension
that `composer.json` or a locked package requires as `ext-<name>`. An
extension that nixpkgs has under `php.extensions` is added. When nixpkgs
has no extension of that name, `composer install` reports the requirement
as unmet, and the build fails with Composer's message. The `php` argument
replaces the default.

`composer-purifier publish <directory>` copies the `release` that Nix built
into a directory. For projects with Nix inputs, it publishes the projected
archive closure, reusing existing files only when their bytes match. Ordinary
Composer clients can consume the directory as an `artifact` repository.
`--repository-url <base-url>` also writes a static `packages.json` index
for serving that directory as a Composer repository, including for projects
without Nix inputs. Dependencies in the exported metadata use exact
Nix-derived versions.

Packagist publishes a package from the tags of its git
repository and takes no uploads, so for Packagist, publishing means
pushing a tag.

Other limits:

- `lock` runs with Composer plugins disabled, since `vendor` does not exist
  yet. A plugin that rewrites download URLs (`PRE_FILE_DOWNLOAD`) makes
  `composer install` look for a different cache path, and the offline
  install then fails.
- A test runner that downloads its own tools when it first runs works only
  with the network. The `simple-phpunit` of symfony/phpunit-bridge installs
  PHPUnit with Composer the first time it runs, and that download is not
  part of `composer.lock`. A project whose tests run offline requires
  `phpunit/phpunit` in `require-dev` instead.
- The hash of a GitHub dist is the hash of the zip archive that GitHub
  generates. If GitHub changes how it generates archives, the fetch fails
  with a hash mismatch, and `lock --force` records the new hashes.
- The offline installs set `COMPOSER_POLICY=0`, which turns off the
  install-time policy of Composer 2.10. That policy fetches malware and
  advisory lists from the package repositories, which an offline install
  cannot reach. `lock` runs the same check online, with `composer audit`.

## Examples

For day-to-day work on these projects, use the native-tool setup and
commands in [Quickstart](#quickstart) and [Development loop](#development-loop).
The Nix expressions below show optional sandboxed packaging of those
projects.

### Composer itself

[composer/composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) is built the way
the Quickstart builds any project. Check out the release you want, lock it,
and build its `composer` executable from the checkout:

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/composer-purifier#toolchain'
git clone --branch 2.10.3 https://github.com/composer/composer
cd composer
composer-purifier lock
nix build --impure --expr 'let
  purifier = builtins.getFlake "github:nix-purifiers/composer-purifier";
  pkgs = import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs {
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    overlays = [ purifier.overlays.default ];
  };
in
(pkgs.composer-purifier.buildComposerProject { src = ./.; })
.packages.composer'
./result/bin/composer --version
```

To move to a newer release, check out its tag and run the same commands
again.
