# cabal-purifier

cabal-purifier keeps Cabal's development workflow on locked,
Nix-resolved dependencies. Use the normal build and test commands in your
working tree; building the project itself in the Nix sandbox is an
optional next step.

## Quickstart

From the project root:

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/cabal-purifier'
cabal-purifier lock
eval "$(cabal-purifier prefetch)"
cabal build
cabal test
```

Commit the lockfiles that the lock command writes, including the build
tool's own lockfile when it has one. Keep using the project's usual build,
test and editor commands with this setup. Nix provides the locked
dependencies; the development commands above run outside the Nix sandbox.
No project Nix files are needed for this workflow.

Sandboxed builds of the whole project are an optional
[next step](#building-the-project-with-nix).

The shell provides both `cabal-purifier` and the native `cabal` wrapper. With a
purifier lock, the wrapper uses Nix-resolved dependencies. Without one, it
warns on standard error and runs ordinary, impure Cabal, including outside a
project. `prefetch` also supplies a project-local wrapper and preserves your existing runtime.

For persistent use, add these packages through your usual Nix configuration.


## Development loop

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/cabal-purifier'
eval "$(cabal-purifier prefetch)"
cabal build
cabal test
```

`prefetch` (see [Working offline](#working-offline)) puts a `cabal` shim first
on `PATH`. The shim runs cabal against the locked sources, so the
everyday commands are cabal commands: `cabal build`, `cabal run my-app`
and `cabal test`. When a project file changed since the lock, the shim
exits with an error that says to run `cabal-purifier lock`.

To lock after a change, or to move dependencies:

- `cabal-purifier lock` records the resolution that Cabal makes, as it
  is. A `cabal.project.freeze` stays as it is, and Cabal resolves to the
  versions it pins. The freeze file records versions, flags and an index
  state but no hashes, so `lock` writes `cabal-purifier.lock.json` every
  time, with the hashes and the Hackage revisions that the build needs.
  Without a freeze file, the plan uses the package index as of the last
  lock, so adding a dependency keeps every other package where it was.
  Locking an unchanged project writes the same file byte for byte.
- `cabal-purifier update [<package>...]` re-resolves the named packages,
  or every package, with the newest package index, writes
  `cabal.project.freeze` again when the project has one, and then locks.
  Afterwards both files pass the staleness check.
- `cabal-purifier publish <package> [--documentation]` uploads what Nix
  built: the source tarball of the package, taken from `release`, or with
  `--documentation` its documentation tarball, with `cabal upload` as a
  package candidate. Options after the package name go to `cabal upload`,
  so `--publish` publishes the release, and credentials work as they do
  for `cabal upload`.

`--no-tests` and `--no-benchmarks` lock a plan without test suites or
benchmarks, for a project whose test dependencies do not resolve.

### How the lock is made

`cabal-purifier lock` runs `cabal update` in an empty Cabal directory, so
your own Cabal configuration does not apply, and then plans the project
with `cabal build all --dry-run`, with tests and benchmarks enabled. The
package index is the one thing it keeps between runs, in
`~/.cache/cabal-purifier` (or under `XDG_CACHE_HOME`), because Cabal
updates an index it already has in place: the first lock downloads the
whole Hackage index, and later ones take seconds. The command plans once for
each system. Cabal takes the platform it plans for from the output of
`ghc --info`, so the command plans for the other systems through a GHC
wrapper that reports the system it plans for and never compiles anything.
One machine therefore locks every system.

The lock run follows `with-compiler` in your native Cabal configuration
(including `CABAL_CONFIG`), overridden by project files, then defaults to
`ghc` on your `PATH`. The development shim also honors Cabal’s explicit
`-w PATH`, `-wPATH` and `--with-compiler=PATH` selections. It reads the
compiler choice before applying its isolated locked-repository configuration. Install GHC and Cabal before local adoption; no
maintainer version table limits the host compiler. Local prefetch and
development keep those tools. The optional `cliWithToolchain` package
adds a bundled GHC fallback after your existing `PATH`.

Full sandboxed builds use an immutable SDK: by default the nixpkgs GHC of
the exact version the lock names, or the builder's explicit `ghc` override.
Availability of a packaged SDK constrains those builds separately from local adoption.

From each plan (`plan.json`), the command records:

- each package from Hackage (or another package repository) with the
  SHA-256 of the tarball that the plan gives. When Hackage holds a
  revision of the package description, the command finds its number in
  the package index and records the URL of that revision,
  `revision/<n>.cabal`, which never changes. The `pkg-cabal-sha256` of
  the plan is the hash of that file.
- each `source-repository-package` at its locked revision, with the hash
  of its checkout.
- each package URL in `packages:`, with the SHA-256 of its tarball.
- the version and the flags of every package, and which packages the
  compiler provides.
- the components of each package of the project. These are the outputs of
  `buildCabalProject`.

Cabal files record no hashes, so the lockfile holds what the build needs
from them. `cabal.project.freeze` pins versions and the index state, and
the lockfile adds the hashes and the revisions. The lockfile holds a
format `version` and a `hash` of its own content. It records the index
state it planned with (`indexState`), which the next `lock` plans with
again. An `index-state` in the files of the project takes precedence, and
the lockfile then records none.

The command then checks the lock: it fetches the locked sources through
Nix and plans the project again from those alone, and the plan must match
the lock.

## Building the project with Nix

Once the native development workflow is working, you can also build and
test the whole project in the Nix sandbox. For this step, keep a flake or
another Nix build definition in the project's repository, or maintain an
external packaging repository that points at its sources and lockfiles.
The builder consumes the same lockfiles as the development workflow.

The overlay of the flake, `overlays.default`, adds one attribute to a
package set, the scope `cabal-purifier`, which holds the builder
`buildCabalProject`. A project whose authors want a flake can package
itself with the builder. The flake lives in the repository of the project
or in another one, and it calls the builder directly:

```nix
{
  inputs.cabal-purifier.url =
    "github:nix-purifiers/cabal-purifier";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "cabal-purifier/nixpkgs";

  outputs =
    {
      nixpkgs,
      cabal-purifier,
      self,
      ...
    }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        inherit system;
        overlays = [ cabal-purifier.overlays.default ];
      };
      project = pkgs.cabal-purifier.buildCabalProject {
        src = self;
        # Libraries outside Cabal, such as zlib for
        # `pkgconfig-depends: zlib`.
        nativeBuildInputs = [ pkgs.pkg-config ];
        buildInputs = [ pkgs.zlib ];
      };
    in
    {
      packages.${system} = {
        default =
          project.packages.my-app.executables.my-app;
        release = project.release;
      };
      checks.${system}.tests = project.tests;
    };
}
```

`cabal-purifier.overrideScope` replaces what the scope shares, and
`cabal-purifier.buildCabalProject.override` replaces what the builder
takes from the package set. `buildCabalProject` returns these attributes,
and Nix knows every name when it evaluates, without building anything:

- `packages.<package>`, for each package of the project:
  - `executables.<name>`, each executable at `bin/<name>`;
  - `testSuites.<name>`, a run of each test suite in a copy of the
    package directory;
  - `benchmarks.<name>`, each benchmark at `bin/<name>`;
  - `sdist`, the source tarball that `cabal sdist` makes, and `docs`, the
    documentation tarball for Hackage from
    `cabal haddock --haddock-for-hackage`; `.tarball` names the file of
    each;
  - `library`, `sublibraries` and `foreignLibraries`, the library
    components as the lock records them.
- `tests`, the run of every test suite of the project.
- `release`, a directory with the source tarball of each package, the
  files that `cabal-purifier publish` uploads.
- `fetches`, the entries of the
  [purifier library](https://github.com/nix-purifiers/purifier) that the
  build fetches, for SBOM, license and vulnerability tools.
- `project`, the build of every component of every package, by
  `cabal build all` against the locked plan, and `repository`, the locked
  sources.

The builder also takes `ghc` (the default is the nixpkgs GHC of the
version the lock names), `cabalFlags` for more arguments to every cabal
command, `srcFilter`, `externalPaths` for local packages outside the
project (see [Supported language repositories](#supported-language-repositories)),
and `fetchers`. A company mirror or credentials go into
`fetchers.fetchurl` (and `fetchers.fetchgit` for a private git
repository), which the purifier library's `fetchEntry` calls with the
arguments of the nixpkgs fetcher of that name.

### C ABI foreign-library projections

On native Linux, explicitly select one locked `foreign-library` component to
expose its installed shared library to C, Python FFI and Java FFM:

```nix
let
  built = pkgs.cabal-purifier.buildCabalProject {
    src = ./.;
    nativeProducts.answer = {
      selector = "my-package:flib:answer";
      abi = "c";
      exports = [ "my_answer" "my_init" "my_term" ];
      runtime = {
        kind = "ghc";
        lifecycle = "process-once";
        threading = "single-foreign-thread";
        init = "my_init";
        term = "my_term";
      };
    };
  };
in built.projections
```

The `native`, `python-ffi` and `java-ffi` projections contain a `catalog.json`
with the exact library and include paths, a lazy Python `purifier_native.load`
helper, and Java `java.args`. Set compatible signatures before calling native
functions. The actual GHC-generated export headers and compiler `HsFFI.h`
headers are included; `native-products.json` in the catalog's producer prefix
records native and selected artifact hashes, loader edits, compiler identity
and exact runtime dependency origins.

The selected package and reachable local library packages must explicitly use
`build-type: Simple`. The native builder uses Cabal's resolved component plan
and Setup installation. It retains the immutable local build tree, compiled
Cabal store and GHC runtime. Installed local library bytes are verified before
selected copies receive absolute dependency references, including transitive
local packages supplied through `externalPaths`.

The package supplies its own C ABI initialization and shutdown functions.
Initialize the GHC runtime once before foreign calls, use one foreign thread,
then shut it down once at the end of the process. Reinitialization, concurrent
foreign threads and general safe unloading are outside this contract. The
builder validates the declared exports; it does not infer their signatures or
generate runtime lifecycle functions.

`nativeProducts` defaults to an empty set. Existing outputs and the
`packages.<name>.foreignLibraries` component-name lists keep their behavior.
Native builds use the locked local repository in the Nix build sandbox and
verify a warm `--offline` replay. A cold Cabal `--offline` build rejects the
`file+noindex` source transport on the tested SDK; it is a separate boundary.
Darwin and cross compilation are unsupported for these projections.

### A lockfile outside the project

The recommended setup is the one above: both lockfiles lie in the
repository of the project. A flake that packages a project whose author
does not change it can keep them outside the project tree and pass them to
the builder:

```nix
pkgs.cabal-purifier.buildCabalProject {
  src = inputs.some-project;
  lockFile = ./locks/some-project.lock.json;
  # A cabal.project.freeze that replaces the one in
  # `src`, when needed.
  cabalFreeze =
    ./locks/some-project.cabal.project.freeze;
}
```

A `lockFile` outside `src` takes the place of any lockfile in it, and
`cabalFreeze` takes the place of the `cabal.project.freeze` in it. Every
command takes `--lockfile <path>` and `--tool-lockfile <path>` for the two
files, or the environment variables `CABAL_PURIFIER_LOCKFILE` and
`CABAL_PURIFIER_TOOL_LOCKFILE`, and either form takes precedence over the
default files in the project. With `--tool-lockfile`, `lock` and `update`
write the freeze file there and leave the copy in the project as it is.
When the file does not exist yet, they start from the copy in the project.
The dev shell of the flake can set the variables to the paths it passes to
the builder, so that a developer runs the commands with no flag.

### One-off builds without a project Nix file

For an ad hoc build, the builder can also be evaluated directly from the
project root. Replace the example package name with one from your project:

```zsh
nix build --impure --expr 'let
  purifier = builtins.getFlake "github:nix-purifiers/cabal-purifier";
  pkgs = import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs {
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    overlays = [ purifier.overlays.default ];
  };
in
(pkgs.cabal-purifier.buildCabalProject { src = ./.; })
.packages.my-app.executables.my-app'
```

This uses the purifier's pinned nixpkgs, matching the lock command above.
To build with ambient `<nixpkgs>` from your Nix search path instead,
replace `import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs` with `import <nixpkgs>`.
Both forms need no Nix files in your project. The build tool and language
versions must match the lockfile; with ambient nixpkgs, lock with the
purifier from that package set or pass a compatible toolchain to the builder.

## Working offline

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/cabal-purifier'
eval "$(cabal-purifier prefetch)"
```

`prefetch` realizes the locked dependency sources for the current system.
It keeps your existing GHC and Cabal; it does not install GHC or a language
server. The selected compiler must match the lock's compiler version and
native target, and its `ghc-pkg` must belong to the same GHC version. If you
change compilers, run `cabal-purifier lock` with the new compiler first.
These checks do not claim ABI identity from the version alone; Cabal still
checks actual package and compiler capabilities while resolving and building.

For an explicit packaged development toolchain, use
`eval "$(cabal-purifier prefetch --with-toolchain)"`. This convenience
requires a packaged GHC matching the lock and includes HLS when available.
A missing packaged compiler does not prevent default local adoption.

It keeps them alive with a garbage-collector root,
`cabal-purifier.lock.prefetch`, beside the lockfile, writes the shim to
`dist-newstyle/cabal-purifier/bin/cabal`, and prints a `PATH` export that
puts only the shim first by default, followed by your existing `PATH`. With
`--with-toolchain`, the requested toolchain follows the shim. After a prefetch, `cabal build`,
`cabal run`, `cabal test` and the editor work with the network cut off.

The shim runs cabal with a Cabal directory whose only repository is the
locked one, and with an offline copy of the configuration of the project. The
Cabal directory belongs to the command, so your `~/.config/cabal/config`
does not apply, and the package store is under
`dist-newstyle/cabal-purifier/cabal`.

### How the build resolves offline

The Nix builder makes a Cabal no-index repository (`file+noindex://`) of
the locked sources. It holds each package tarball, each Hackage revision
of a package description as `<name>-<version>.cabal` beside its tarball,
and each package from a source repository as a tarball packed from its
locked checkout. The build runs cabal with that repository as its only
repository, and with an offline copy of the configuration of the project
(`pkgs/build-cabal-project/offline_project.py`). The copy leaves out the
`source-repository-package` and `repository` sections and the
`index-state`, replaces each package URL with its unpacked directory, and
adds the constraints of the lock, so Cabal resolves to the locked plan.
After the build, the builder compares the plan that Cabal made with the
lock and fails on
any difference.

## Editor

`prefetch` puts the `cabal` shim first on `PATH` and preserves your existing
language server. `--with-toolchain` can supply packaged HLS when available.
An editor started from that shell, or with that
`PATH`, loads the project through the shim, so the build tool calls of the
language server go to the locked sources and nothing is downloaded.
A `.envrc` with the `eval` line from [Working offline](#working-offline) does
the same for direnv.

## Troubleshooting

The Nix library checks the lockfile whenever it reads it (`readLock`
returns the problems, and the builder fails evaluation with them), and
the command makes the same checks. Each problem names the command that
fixes it, which is `cabal-purifier lock` for every one of these:

| Problem | What the message says |
| --- | --- |
| A project file changed since the lock | `hello.cabal changed since the lock`, and the shim exits with an error. |
| The lockfile is not valid JSON | `is not valid JSON` with the position. |
| A section is missing, or the format `version` differs from the one this command writes | `is damaged: it has no <sections>`, or the version the file has and the version this command writes. |
| The lockfile changed after `lock` wrote it | `its content does not match its hash`. |
| A repository file or package URL names a download the lock lacks, or a plan uses a package no locked source provides | `names no download <path>` or `uses <package>, which no locked source provides`. |
| A download no longer matches its hash | Nix reports the mismatch, and the command says the lockfile was edited or the source changed upstream. |
| A build whose plan differs from the lock | The build lists the packages that differ. |
| A dependency newer than the recorded index state | Cabal cannot plan it, and the command says to run `cabal-purifier update`. |

## Supported language repositories

Every kind of source that cabal-install fetches works:

- **Hackage and other package repositories**, with Hackage revisions of
  package descriptions. A repository that needs credentials takes them
  through `fetchers.fetchurl`.
- **Git source repositories** (`source-repository-package` with
  `type: git`), with their submodules, which Cabal checks out too. The Nix
  sandbox has no SSH keys, so a repository over SSH is locked at the HTTPS
  URL of the same host and path. A private repository takes a credentialed
  fetcher through `fetchers.fetchgit`. The lock run itself uses your SSH
  keys and git credentials.
- **Mercurial and Darcs source repositories.** A Mercurial source needs a
  `tag`. A Darcs source without a `tag` is locked by the Darcs context of
  the checkout Cabal made in the lock run.
- **Package URLs** in `packages:`.
- **Local packages inside the project**, which are the outputs of the project,
  and **local tarballs and no-index repositories inside the project**.
- **Local packages outside the project**, such as `packages: ../shared`.
  The lock lists them as `externalPaths`, and the build takes each tree as
  an argument, keyed by the path the lock gives it:

  ```nix
pkgs.cabal-purifier.buildCabalProject {
  src = ./.;
  externalPaths."../shared" = inputs.shared;
}
```

The command refuses these:

- **Subversion, Bazaar, CVS and Pijul source repositories.** cabal-install
  does not sync them (`cabal update` fails with "sync repo not yet
  supported", or with `SourceRepoRepoTypeUnsupported` for Pijul), so a
  project cannot use them and there is nothing to lock.
- **Local packages given by absolute path.** A Nix build can create files
  only inside its own build directory, so it cannot put a tree at an
  absolute path. Paths relative to the project work.
- **Imports by URL in `cabal.project`.** Cabal fetches such an import while
  it reads the project, before any build step, so the offline copy cannot
  hold it, and the command explains this. Imports of local files work.

A `.cabal` file names system libraries (`extra-libraries`,
`pkgconfig-depends`) but not where they come from, so the builder takes
them as `nativeBuildInputs` and `buildInputs`.

## Examples

For day-to-day work on these projects, use the native-tool setup and
commands in [Quickstart](#quickstart) and [Development loop](#development-loop).
The Nix expressions below show optional sandboxed packaging of those
projects.

### ShellCheck

[ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is a single Haskell
package with a library, an executable and a test suite, and no
`cabal.project`. To build it with Nix, lock it in a checkout of the
release:

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/cabal-purifier'
git clone --branch v0.11.0 \
  https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck
cd shellcheck
cabal-purifier lock --lockfile \
  ../shellcheck.lock.json
```

The lockfile goes outside the checkout, because the author of ShellCheck
does not keep one. Build the release from the checkout, with the lockfile
passed to the builder:

```zsh
nix build --impure --expr 'let
  purifier = builtins.getFlake "github:nix-purifiers/cabal-purifier";
  pkgs = import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs {
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    overlays = [ purifier.overlays.default ];
  };
in
(pkgs.cabal-purifier.buildCabalProject {
  src = ./.;
  lockFile = ../shellcheck.lock.json;
}).packages.ShellCheck.executables.shellcheck'
```

`./result/bin/shellcheck` is ShellCheck, built in the sandbox. To run its
test suite, build `.tests` of the same project in place of the executable.
To work on ShellCheck itself, run this in the checkout, and then use
`cabal build` and `cabal test` as usual:

```zsh
nix shell 'github:nix-purifiers/cabal-purifier'
eval "$(cabal-purifier prefetch --lockfile ../shellcheck.lock.json)"
```
