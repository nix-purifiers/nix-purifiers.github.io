# cargo-purifier

cargo-purifier keeps Cargo's development workflow on locked,
Nix-resolved dependencies. Use the normal build and test commands in your
working tree; building the project itself in the Nix sandbox is an
optional next step.

cargo keeps planning and compiling the build. `Cargo.lock` already pins
every registry download by name, version and checksum, so cargo-purifier
reuses it, and writes `cargo-purifier.lock.json` beside it only for what
`Cargo.lock` cannot record.

## Quickstart

From the project root:

```zsh
nix shell \
  'github:nix-purifiers/cargo-purifier#cargo' \
  'github:nix-purifiers/cargo-purifier#cargo-purifier'
cargo-purifier lock
cargo-purifier prefetch
cargo build
cargo test
```

Commit the lockfiles that the lock command writes, including the build
tool's own lockfile when it has one. Keep using the project's usual build,
test and editor commands with this setup. Nix provides the locked
dependencies; the development commands above run outside the Nix sandbox.
No project Nix files are needed for this workflow.

Sandboxed builds of the whole project are an optional
[next step](#building-the-project-with-nix).

The shell provides the `cargo` wrapper. Use it for the locked
development workflow. With no purifier lockfile, it warns on standard
error and runs the ordinary tool with impure resolution.

For persistent use, add these packages through your usual Nix configuration.


## Development loop

The `cargo-purifier` package holds the command, a `cargo` wrapper and a
`rust-analyzer` wrapper. In a workspace with a `cargo-purifier.lock.json`,
the wrapper's `cargo build`, `check`, `run`, `test`, `bench`, `doc`,
`clippy`, `rustc`, `rustdoc`, `tree`, `metadata`, `package` and `fix` read
every registry and git source from a vendored copy that Nix builds from
the two lockfiles, and run with `--offline`. Incremental compilation works
as usual. Every other command, such as `update`, `add` or `publish`, runs
plain cargo.

To add a dependency, run `cargo add`, then `cargo-purifier lock`. To
upgrade, run `cargo-purifier update`, which runs `cargo update` for every
package, or for the packages it names, and then locks the result. Commit
both lockfiles either way. `cargo-purifier lock` keeps cargo's resolution:
it runs `cargo fetch`, which brings `Cargo.lock` up to date with the
manifests and changes no more than it must. It then hashes each git
checkout with `nix-prefetch-git`, submodules included, and reads the index
configuration of each registry other than crates.io. A relock of an
unchanged workspace reproduces the lockfile byte for byte, and hashes only
the git checkouts that changed. A command that needs a download the
lockfiles do not record stops, and names `cargo-purifier lock`.
`CARGO_PURIFIER=0` runs plain cargo, which downloads what it needs.

### The Nix build

`cargo-purifier.buildCargoProject { src, lockFile ? …, cargoLock ? …, fetchers ? { }, ... }`
returns:

| Attribute | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages.<package>` | every workspace package with a binary or an installable library, built with `cargo build --package <package>` |
| `packages.<package>.bins.<binary>` | `$out/bin/<binary>` |
| `packages.<package>.libs."lib<name>.so"`, `."lib<name>.a"` | the libraries of `cdylib`, `dylib` and `staticlib` targets |
| `tests` | `cargo test --workspace`, in the sandbox |
| `release.<package>` | the .crate of `cargo package --package <package>`; `release.<package>.crate` is its path |
| `fetches` | every download: the entries of the lock in memory |
| `vendor` | the vendored sources every build reads |

Evaluation knows every attribute and path from the lockfiles, without
building anything or importing generated Nix code. A plain Rust library
(`rlib`) is only usable compiled into something, so it has a release and
no package.

### The lock in memory

`lib.cargo-purifier.readLock { src, workspace ? ".", lockFile ? …, cargoLock ? … }` reads
both lockfiles into the shape every purifier shares: `purifier`,
`entries`, `outputs` and `problems`. `entries` are download entries of the
[purifier library](https://github.com/nix-purifiers/purifier): a file
entry per registry crate, from the checksum in `Cargo.lock`, and a git
entry per checkout. Each also carries `cargo = { source, name, version }`.
Cargo downloads are the same on every system, so no entry has `systems`.
`outputs` names every workspace package, with its binaries, library and
version, and `problems` holds the reasons the lockfiles cannot be used.
Reading never fails, except on a purifier lockfile that looks like a JSON
object and does not parse, which Nix cannot catch; that error still names
the file and the fix. The builder passes the lock to the library's
`checkLock`, and builds the entries `entriesFor` gives for the host
system.

`fetchers.fetchurl` and `fetchers.fetchgit` replace nixpkgs' fetchers for
every download, crates.io included, for a mirror or credentials.
`nix/lib/build-cargo-project.nix` documents the other arguments: `doCheck`
also runs each package's tests in its build, and `srcFilter` chooses the
files of a path `src` the builds see. The builder takes the packages it
builds with by name from the scope, so
`cargo-purifier.overrideScope (final: prev: { rustPlatform = …; })` builds
with another Rust toolchain, and `buildCargoProject.override` replaces a
package for the builder alone.

### Lockfiles outside the source

An external build is an option for a workspace whose repository does not
hold the lockfiles: a packaging flake that builds a workspace its author
does not change, or a library that does not commit `Cargo.lock`. The
packaging flake keeps the lockfiles and passes them to the builder.
`lockFile` names the purifier lockfile, and `cargoLock` names a
`Cargo.lock` that the builds use in place of any copy in `src`.

Every command takes `--lockfile <path>` and `--tool-lockfile <path>`, or
reads the same paths from `CARGO_PURIFIER_LOCKFILE` and
`CARGO_PURIFIER_TOOL_LOCKFILE`. A development shell of the packaging flake
can set both variables to the paths it passes to the builder. With an
outside `Cargo.lock`, `cargo-purifier lock` and `update` run cargo on it,
write the result there, and leave the workspace's own `Cargo.lock` as it
was. When the outside file does not exist yet, they start from the
workspace's copy. cargo reads `Cargo.lock` only from the workspace root, so
the cargo wrapper copies the outside `Cargo.lock` there before it runs
cargo.

### Publish

```zsh
cargo-purifier publish --package greet
```

`cargo-purifier publish` has Nix build `release.<package>` from the
workspace, and uploads that .crate file to crates.io, or to the registry
`--registry <name>` names in cargo's configuration. The upload is a request
to the registry's publish API, of the kind `cargo publish` sends, with the
metadata read from the normalized `Cargo.toml` inside the crate. The token
comes from where cargo keeps it: `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` or
`CARGO_REGISTRIES_<NAME>_TOKEN`, or `credentials.toml` as `cargo login`
writes it. `--dry-run` prints the metadata and uploads nothing.

### Decisions

- Each package builds with its own `cargo build --package`, so a package's
  build does not depend on its siblings. They share the vendored sources,
  not compiled crates.
- `doCheck` is off by default, so a test suite that needs the network does
  not break a package's build; `tests` runs the whole suite.
- `cargo-purifier publish` uploads through the registry API itself,
  because `cargo publish` always packages the crate again before
  uploading.
- The vendoring of crates.io and git sources is nixpkgs'
  `importCargoLock`, which places each crate of a checkout by name and
  resolves `workspace = true` inheritance in vendored manifests.

## Building the project with Nix

Once the native development workflow is working, you can also build and
test the whole project in the Nix sandbox. For this step, keep a flake or
another Nix build definition in the project's repository, or maintain an
external packaging repository that points at its sources and lockfiles.
The builder consumes the same lockfiles as the development workflow.

A flake can package the workspace by calling the builder directly. It can
live in the repository of the workspace or in another one:

```nix
{
  inputs.cargo-purifier.url =
    "github:nix-purifiers/cargo-purifier";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "cargo-purifier/nixpkgs";

  outputs =
    { nixpkgs, cargo-purifier, ... }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        inherit system;
        overlays = [ cargo-purifier.overlays.default ];
      };
      project = pkgs.cargo-purifier.buildCargoProject {
        src = ./.;
      };
    in
    {
      packages.${system}.hello = project.packages.hello;
      checks.${system}.tests = project.tests;
    };
}
```

For the development loop and the editor, put the `cargo-purifier` package
of the scope on the `PATH`, for example in a development shell as
`pkgs.cargo-purifier.cargo-purifier`, and prefetch once:

```zsh
cargo-purifier prefetch
```

### One-off builds without a project Nix file

For an ad hoc build, the builder can also be evaluated directly from the
project root. Replace the example package name with one from your project:

```zsh
nix build --impure --expr 'let
  purifier = builtins.getFlake "github:nix-purifiers/cargo-purifier";
  pkgs = import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs {
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    overlays = [ purifier.overlays.default ];
  };
in
(pkgs.cargo-purifier.buildCargoProject { src = ./.; })
.packages.hello'
```

This uses the purifier's pinned nixpkgs, matching the lock command above.
To build with ambient `<nixpkgs>` from your Nix search path instead,
replace `import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs` with `import <nixpkgs>`.
Both forms need no Nix files in your project. The build tool and language
versions must match the lockfile; with ambient nixpkgs, lock with the
purifier from that package set or pass a compatible toolchain to the builder.

## Working offline

`cargo-purifier prefetch` builds, in the Nix store, everything the
development loop and the editor need: the vendored sources, the
`cargo-purifier` package with its cargo, rustc, C compiler and
rust-analyzer, and the standard library's sources. It keeps them alive with
a garbage-collector root at `target/cargo-purifier/prefetch`, and records
the vendored sources for the wrapper, which then needs no Nix call. After a
prefetch, `cargo build`, `run`, `test` and rust-analyzer work with the
network cut off.

`cargo clean` removes the root with the rest of `target`, so prefetch
again before the next stretch of offline work.

The toolchain that a prefetch keeps is the Rust of the package set the
`cargo-purifier` package was built from. A `rust-toolchain.toml` file in the
workspace names a toolchain that rustup downloads, and cargo-purifier
builds with the package set's Rust instead; to build with another one,
pass it to `cargo-purifier.overrideScope`.

## Editor

Point the editor at the `rust-analyzer` of the `cargo-purifier` package,
for example `target/cargo-purifier/prefetch/tools/bin/rust-analyzer` after
a prefetch. It runs `cargo metadata` and `cargo check` through the cargo
wrapper, so it loads the workspace and its dependencies from the vendored
sources, and it reads the standard library's sources from the package
set's rust-src.

## Troubleshooting

| Mistake | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Cargo.lock` changed since the lock (an upgrade, or a hand edit) | "… was made from a different Cargo.lock. Run `cargo-purifier lock` and commit both files." The wrapper stops with the same reason. |
| A dependency added to `Cargo.toml` but not locked | The wrapper stops: "Cargo.toml needs dependencies that Cargo.lock lacks. Run `cargo-purifier lock` to lock them." |
| The purifier lockfile edited by hand | "… was changed after `cargo-purifier lock` wrote it. Run `cargo-purifier lock` to write it again." |
| A git dependency missing from the purifier lockfile | "… has no hash for the git dependency <name>. Run `cargo-purifier lock`." |
| A registry missing from the purifier lockfile | "… has no entry for the registry <source>. Run `cargo-purifier lock`." |
| A malformed or incomplete purifier lockfile | The error names the file, with "run `cargo-purifier lock` to write it again". |
| Offline, with sources never prefetched | The wrapper stops with Nix's reason, and says to run `cargo-purifier prefetch` while online. |
| A hash that does not match the download | Nix reports a hash mismatch for the crate or checkout. The upstream changed what it serves under that version or commit; `cargo-purifier lock` records what it serves now. |

## Supported language repositories

| Source in Cargo.lock | How the build gets it |
|---|---|
| crates.io | nixpkgs `importCargoLock`, by the checksum in `Cargo.lock` |
| Another registry, git or sparse index | the URL its `dl` template gives, with all of cargo's markers, by the checksum in `Cargo.lock` |
| git, over HTTPS or any URL Nix can fetch | `fetchgit` with submodules, by the hash in the purifier lockfile |
| git over `ssh://` | the same repository over HTTPS from the same host, since the sandbox holds no SSH keys; a private repository needs a credentialed `fetchers.fetchgit` |
| path | the build's `src` |

A path dependency outside the workspace root builds when `src` is a
directory that holds both, and `workspace` names the workspace inside it,
as in `{ src = ./.; workspace = "app"; }`. The builds use the package set's
Rust toolchain, and do not read `rust-toolchain.toml`. cargo-purifier runs
on x86_64-linux and aarch64-linux.

### What the purifier lockfile holds

Each field of `cargo-purifier.lock.json` is something Nix cannot get from
`Cargo.lock` or `Cargo.toml` at evaluation time. crates.io crates appear
only in `Cargo.lock`.

| Field | Why `Cargo.lock` cannot supply it |
|---|---|
| `version` | the purifier lockfile's own format |
| `contentHash` | the hash of the file's own content, which shows a hand edit |
| `cargoLock` | the hash of the `Cargo.lock` it was made from; a `Cargo.lock` cannot vouch that it is unchanged |
| `git[]` | `Cargo.lock` records a git dependency's commit, but a fixed-output fetch needs the checkout's NAR hash, with submodules |
| `registries.<source>.dl` | a registry's download URL template is in its index's `config.json`, which evaluation cannot fetch without import-from-derivation |
| `packages.<package>.bins`, `.lib` | the outputs: cargo finds binaries in `src/main.rs` and `src/bin/` without manifest entries, members may be globs, and the library's name and crate types decide its file names |

## Examples

For day-to-day work on these projects, use the native-tool setup and
commands in [Quickstart](#quickstart) and [Development loop](#development-loop).
The Nix expressions below show optional sandboxed packaging of those
projects.

### ripgrep in its own checkout

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a cargo workspace whose
`rg` binary comes from its root package. To work on it with
cargo-purifier, lock it once at the root of a checkout, and build it from
there:

```zsh
nix shell \
  'github:nix-purifiers/cargo-purifier#cargo' \
  'github:nix-purifiers/cargo-purifier#cargo-purifier'
git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
cd ripgrep
cargo-purifier lock
nix build --impure --expr 'let
  purifier = builtins.getFlake "github:nix-purifiers/cargo-purifier";
  pkgs = import purifier.inputs.nixpkgs {
    system = builtins.currentSystem;
    overlays = [ purifier.overlays.default ];
  };
in
(pkgs.cargo-purifier.buildCargoProject { src = ./.; })
.packages.ripgrep'
```

`nix build` leaves `rg` at `result/bin/rg`. For the development loop,
prefetch once with the `cargo-purifier` package on the `PATH`, and run
`cargo build`, `cargo test` and rust-analyzer as usual, online or offline.

### ripgrep packaged from outside

A packaging flake can build ripgrep without changing ripgrep's repository.
Keep the purifier lockfile in the packaging flake, and write it from a
checkout of the release you package:

```zsh
cargo-purifier lock --manifest-path ~/src/ripgrep/Cargo.toml \
  --lockfile ./ripgrep.lock.json
```

```nix
{
  inputs.cargo-purifier.url =
    "github:nix-purifiers/cargo-purifier";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "cargo-purifier/nixpkgs";
  inputs.ripgrep = {
    url = "github:BurntSushi/ripgrep/14.1.1";
    flake = false;
  };

  outputs =
    {
      nixpkgs,
      cargo-purifier,
      ripgrep,
      ...
    }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = import nixpkgs {
        inherit system;
        overlays = [ cargo-purifier.overlays.default ];
      };
      project = pkgs.cargo-purifier.buildCargoProject {
        src = ripgrep;
        lockFile = ./ripgrep.lock.json;
      };
    in
    {
      packages.${system}.ripgrep =
        project.packages.ripgrep;
    };
}
```

When ripgrep releases a new version, move the `ripgrep` input to it, run the
same `cargo-purifier lock` on a checkout of that version, and commit both
files.

## Credits

The purifier idea was inspired by nixcloud's
[cargo (libnix)](https://github.com/nixcloud/cargo).

nixpkgs `rustPlatform.importCargoLock` vendors the crates.io and git
dependencies. [crane](https://github.com/ipetkov/crane) and
[naersk](https://github.com/nix-community/naersk) also build Cargo projects
from `Cargo.lock`.
